<p>For developing a new functionality or just adding a new translation, or suggest a new icons set. You should used Git.</p>

<p><a class="externalLink" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). The main difference with VCS is its distributed form, which means that there is not a single repository centralizing all the code history.<br />
All the code history is in each repository, which means that you have all the history in your local repository as well as in the others.<br />
You can find all the instruction in our community website :&nbsp; <a href="https://www.silverpeas.org/dev/collaboration.html" target="_blank">https://www.silverpeas.org/dev/collaboration.html</a></p>
